Module Main makes use of
	Median Search	to		perform median search
	DNA				to		get data types
it has a function parseArgs which decides what to do given the arguments
	
Module Median Search makes use of
	MotifTrees		to 		perform traversals of trees
	Distances		to		compute a score function
	Forks			to		initialize ForkRegisters and the like
	DNA 			to		get data types
it provides 4 functions, simple, bounding, locking and stm median search

Module Motif Trees makes use of
	Forks			to		handle the creation of new forks
it provides 4 functions, simple, bounding, locking and stm branch and bound traversal
(it is a generic programming algorithm => it'll work for any tree of any data type
if you provide it with a score function)

Module Distances makes use of
	DNA 			to 		get data types
it provides a function to compute a distance function for motifs, given a dna and a motif length


Code -> contains the code
	benchmark is used to get benchmark data
	Data -> contains test data

Report -> contains the report tex files
	-> also contains the raw data
